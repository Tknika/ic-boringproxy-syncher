# IoMBian Configurator Boringproxy Syncher

This service synchronizes the users registered in the [IoMBian Configurator platform](https://iombian-configurator.web.app/) with those of a boringproxy instance. 

To achieve this, the program needs two key configuration parameters:

- A Firebase project service account. The file "service_account_key.json" must be copied to the root folder of the service (/opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher).
- The domain from which the boringproxy server is accessible and the "admin" user's access token. These two parameters must be passed as the following environment variables: "BORINGPROXY_DOMAIN" and "BORINGPROXY_TOKEN".


## Installation

- Clone the repo into a temp folder:

> ```git clone https://github.com/Tknika/ic-boringproxy-syncher.git /tmp/ic-boringproxy-syncher && cd /tmp/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

- Create the installation folder and move the appropiate files (**edit the user**):

> ```sudo mkdir /opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

> ```sudo cp requirements.txt /opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

> ```sudo cp -r src/* /opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

> ```sudo cp systemd/ic-boringproxy-syncher.service /etc/systemd/system/```

> ```sudo chown -R aiturrioz:aiturrioz /opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

- Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

> ```cd /opt/ic-boringproxy-syncher```

> ```python3 -m venv venv```

> ```source venv/bin/activate```

> ```pip install --upgrade pip```

> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Start the script

> ```sudo systemctl enable ic-boringproxy-syncher.service && sudo systemctl start ic-boringproxy-syncher.service```
